There is a large amount of casual smokers that don't carry cigarettes, but end up wanting to smoke while drinking.

Our project solves this problem by providing a tool for quickly and easily locating someone who is at the same bar and willing to give you a cigarette.

##What APIs were used?
We used the Google Places API as well as TextBelt for SMS messaging.

##What tech was used?
We used React.js with Material UI in the front-end. In the back-end we used Node.js and Express for building our server. We used Knex for connecting our Express server to a PostgreSQL database. We also used Socket IO for building out our chat feature.
